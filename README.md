# RickAndMorty
iOS application written in Swift that accesses the API from https://rickandmortyapi.com/ to display the different characters from the series with their most relevant information. This app has been implemented using Combine, SwiftUI and the MVVM architecture pattern, without utilizing any external libraries. The app also includes caching of images and requests, and a character search feature. The visual aspect is basic but imitates what can be seen on the website, since we didn't have a defined design. Some unit tests were included as well as error handling capabilities.
